This is a simple Rails based web app to allow communities 
to suggest and build online bills they would like to become 
laws.  

It is a collaborative bill writing website, where people can 
enter ideas they think should be laws. Anyone else can then 
suggest changes (that the author can accept or reject), tag 
the bills, comment on them, sponsor them, share them with 
friends, etc.

== Installation ==

1. edit config/database.yml

2. create the database : 
	$ mysqladmin [user/pass info] create tobal_dev

3. load the initial schema
	$ rake db:schema:load

4. migrate the database - this loads the admin user
	$ rake migrate
	
5. start the app
	$ ./script/server

Now you can login as 'admin@admin.com' with password 'admin'.  

That lets you access the http://localhost:3000/admin portion 
of the site to enter blog entries.  Otherwise that user is the 
same as any other user.
